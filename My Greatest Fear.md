## My Greatest Fear

My greatest fear is the fear of **home invasion**, because:
1. Both of my neighbours got robbed
2. I do not have much security in my home, in my opinion
3. I have no way to defend myself incase of a home invasion

Maybe to solve these problems, I would buy a [security camera](https://www.amazon.ca/Vision-Indoor-Outdoor-Camera-Assistant/dp/B08R59YH7W?ref_=Oct_d_obs_d_3322618011&pd_rd_w=cnIuo&pf_rd_p=a26ace70-029b-45dd-99a6-bbbb61b20bbb&pf_rd_r=6PF4GY1HN7Y50DVX393W&pd_rd_r=33c96ed6-9f70-43a6-a406-34250cdbbf93&pd_rd_wg=TRsIL&pd_rd_i=B08R59YH7W).

I could also buy a weapon.

I would probably not do any of these though, becaue I am way too lazy.
